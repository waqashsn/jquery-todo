To use, clone/download the repo and open index.html in your browser.<sup>[1](#usageguidelines)</sup>

This is implementation of my another project [Vanilla To-do](https://github.com/waqashsn/Vanilla-to-do-list-app) using JQuery, instead of vanilla Javascript.

#### NOTE 
<sup><a name="usageguidelines">1</a></sup> Since the JQuery library is loaded from a CDN and is not included in the project itself, you must be connected to the internet for this app to work.
